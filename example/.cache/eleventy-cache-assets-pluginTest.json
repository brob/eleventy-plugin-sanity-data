It's a static site generator with some data superpowers.\n\nI've been using its JavaScript data files for years now. I've also been using Markdown files to power this blog. Not too long ago, I discovered the fact that when running data through Eleventy's pagination functionality, you have the option to add those pages to a Collection. If you're able to add data to a Collection, that means that you can mix and match data sources in exciting new ways. \n\nWelcome to an article about mixing a data API with Markdown files to create a blog that can be written in either system. In fact, this article is the first article written on my blog using Sanity.io instead of Markdown files, but every post before this is authored in Markdown! I've contemplated converting my blog posts over to use Sanity since [I joined the company in 2020](https://bryanlrobinson.com/blog/new-city-new-job-new-content/), but the idea of converting all my Markdown files seemed tedious (either manually moving or writing a script to normalize them). With this discovery, an extra 2 files, and an addition to a personal Studio, I can write new posts with Sanity's Studio and keep my old posts in Markdown.\n\n## Prerequisite knowledge\n\n* [Basic 11ty knowledge](https://11ty.dev)\n* \"Hello World\" level knowledge of [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io)\n* If you know a little about [11ty's JavaScript data files](https://bryanlrobinson.com/blog/using-eleventys-javascript-data-files/), [that would help too](https://bryanlrobinson.com/blog/adapt-client-side-javascript-for-use-in-11ty-eleventy-data-files/)\n\n## Getting started\n\nWe need two things to get started: a simplified 11ty blog and a blank Sanity Studio.\n\n* 11ty Blog: \n  * [Clone this starting repository for the 11ty code](https://github.com/brob/11ty-mixnmatch)\n  * Run `npm install` in the project\n  * Run `npm start` to get 11ty running\n* Sanity Studio \n  * Install the Sanity CLI: `npm install -g @sanity/cli`\n  * Run `sanity init` and create a new Sanity project with a blank schema\n  * Need a bit more description about the CLI? Here is the \"[Getting Started with the CLI](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli)\" documentation.\n\nThe 11ty blog is a simplified blog structure. There's one Liquid template, a couple of markdown blog posts in the `/posts` directory, and one collection created in the `.eleventy.js` configuration file.\n\nEach blog post has a little structured data in its frontmatter: a title, description, and date. This is enough to give our templates the data necessary to keep things in order and structured nicely.","categories":["11ty","development"],"description":"This will be the description for the blog post","featuredImg":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-b1bcdd672d86bf97150c57936575e5465b5b80af-4096x2733-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"publishDate":"2021-02-05","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"using-11ty-javascript-data-files-to-mix-markdown-and-cms-content-into-one-collection"},"title":"Using 11ty JavaScript Data files to mix Markdown and CMS content into one collection","date":"2021-02-05"}]
